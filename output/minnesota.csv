Six patients in the SGN group were operated on using a method of variance with the randomisation (Fig. 1). Three of these sustained an intra-operative femoral fracture. In two this was caused by an inadequate surgical technique. In spite of the recommended operative technique, a hammer had been used during insertion of the nail in one patient and in the other a wrong entry point had been used leading to excessive force during insertion of the nail. The intra-operative fractures were all recognised during during the primary procedure and the SGN was exchanged in all cases to a long gamma nail (LGN) with uneventful outcomes. In two patients an LGN had been used because of misinterpretation of the study protocol by the surgeons. Finally, in one case the surgeon considered open reduction to be necessary and therefore intra-operatively changed the SGN to an MSP.""","",7642,234,"",0,"",0,"",0,"",0,""
